# On-Off-Light 
#This is a web-based project featuring an interactive light bulb and a cat illustration. The webpage includes a switch with “On” and “Off” buttons to control the bulb’s illumination. When the “On” button is clicked, the bulb lights up, revealing the entire cat on the screen. Conversely, when the “Off” button is clicked, the bulb turns off, leaving only the cat’s eyes visible in the dark.
